Adding new Pages to the website
Site pages are an approach to give general data about your
business or products. Hand-coding a site without any
preparation and building a site utilizing a substance the board
framework is two of the most widely recognized strategies for
making sites. On account of hand-coding, mark-up dialects like
HTML, CSS and PHP characterize the parts of a website page
(things like features, sections, text styles, and hues) so they'll
render appropriately in your guests' internet browser window,
while scripting dialects like JavaScript control a page's dynamic
substance (slideshows, intelligent maps, looking over video, and
so on.). 

In case you're taking the substance the executives
framework course, programming like WordPress (a web
designer) is utilized to make web content through a drop-down
menu, shapes, and implicit word processors.
When you begin with your site by making a landing page utilizing
HTML, PHP and CSS, that first page should exist as record titled
index.html.

This will be a page you made in a content tool
utilizing HTML code for those basic components like features
and passages, and CSS (either remotely, inside, or inline) for
page designs, hues, and text style types, and Php to use a
localhost or a specified host name which in my case was given
‘v.je’ can be used to connect to the database. In case you're
utilizing an outside template to characterize the presence of
your whole site, you'll additionally have a .css record containing
your outer .css code. Now, those two records (or simply the
index.html document if your CSS is inward or inline) ought to be
in a committed task organizer on your work area. On the off
chance that you've just put your one-page site on the web, you'll
additionally have transferred your index.html record (and .css
document if material) to a web facilitating administration. With
that off the beaten path, you're prepared to begin including
extra pages.


Much the same as you did with your landing page, open up a
content manager and put those HTML and PHP coding abilities
to work. At that point, when you're finished coding, spare this
new page as a .html record with a proper filename—for
example, in case you're making an About page for your site,
name the document about.html. Add this new record to your
task envelope nearby index.html, at that point open up
index.html and include content your landing page with a
connection to the new page you've made—recollect, when you
begin including extra pages it's basic to interface each page to all
the others so guests can explore your site.

To enable monitor this as your site develops in pages, it's a smart thought to make
a sitemap. This can either be an archive kept disconnected, or a
page added to your real site that actually maps out page
position and how each page connects to the others. When
you've finished these means, just transfer and utilize the
database and the new page to your web facilitating
administration by means of FTP (precisely the same way you
transferred your unique landing page), and your most current
expansion to the webpage will be live. By using all the HTML,
PHP and css codes a website can be easily designed. Just like
saving a Html file as .html we can also save a PHP file as .php
and we can have all the html and php and css codes in one file
with correct and proper tags. For html it will be ‘<html>’ and for
php it starts as ‘<?php’ .
In this way we can add new pages to a website.

--Add a new form field to ‘add
product’ form

To add a new form field in any form, in our case it is Add
products form we can use a lot of variables in the css to give the
text box a specific style which will include colour, borders and
various inputs. For inserting any specific data in the text box, we
need to specify the form of the text which will be inserted in the
distinguished text box.

To make it look more user friendly we
can give more spaces between each text box and the required
field. We can use label tag to show the heading of the text box
and the value which should be inserted in the text box. Then to
give it more styling and features we can code a css file and give
it a variable name so that while coding in php or html we can
open a division class and start it with the same name as the
variable name so the form field will inherit all the style given to
the class and show it on the webpage.


Now we have to have more than one form field in the add
products form like the product name, product category, and its
description so we can use the same division class for all the form
fields so that all the form fields will have the same CSS to load
and consist of same style. Now to input in the fields we can use
input tag and give it a text validation using css so a user can type
any text in the form field. In the css file we can use a method key
to give the form a variable

--Add a new form field to ‘add
review’ form

Similar to the add products form we can add a form field to the
add review form. Just same as the earlier we can give a css code
dedicated to the respective form and use the form, label and
input tags so that the user can type in the form fields.
The procedure is really straight forward. We begin with one info
field and let client include more fields until the point when the
check achieves greatest. 

Same process works for erase catch as
well. Whenever clicked, it expels current content field by
expelling guardian component, which is div component
In the code we can characterize a variable which holds the
estimation of greatest number of fields that can be included. We
can set this incentive as wanted Next we have a variable name
which holds id of holder div that contains genuine info which
should be added. By third factor we get to include field catch.
The user will then be able to type in the defined text fields in the
form and in this way we can add a new form field to add review
form.
