<P>I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime.</P>

<p>great phone but a few problems and some thing you need to clear up and be more clear about when i got the phone it was not sealed and when i took it to get it actived i was told it was used other then that everything seems to be in the box and works just fine but you need to let ppl know these phones have been opened</p>

<p>etroPCS initially had issues getting it added to my account, but I woke up the next morning and it was working fine. So, if anyone is wondering it DOES work on MetroPCS/T-Mobile network! :) IN the USA </p>
